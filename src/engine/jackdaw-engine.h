 * jackdaw-engine: one JACK client, named "jackdaw".
 *
 * Phase-1 registered ports:
 *   audio output: out_1 (L master), out_2 (R master)
 *   metronome:    a dedicated mono click output
 * Per-track capture, MIDI and configurable port counts return in phase 2.
 *
 * Threading contract: every non-RT entry point below is single-caller — the
 * main window's looper thread only (plus jackdaw_engine_init/quit from main()
 * before the window exists / after it quits). Other windows must route engine
 * work through the main window via BMessenger, never call in directly.
 */

 * JACK notification threads (port registration, graph changes, server
 * shutdown) must never touch UI or emit GObject signals directly. Instead the
 * engine invokes this hook; the UI implements it as a non-blocking
 * BMessenger::SendMessage to the main window, whose handler re-reads engine
 * state. Set the hook BEFORE jackdaw_engine_init so no event is missed. */
